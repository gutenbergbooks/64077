<p class="drop-capi-t">The State of the Weather in this
Island is so extremely variable and
uncertain, that the Inhabitants are
obliged to keep Fires to sit by near
Eight Months in the Year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> ever since the Duty laid upon Coals,
the Article of Fire has been so very expensive
in many Parts of the Kingdom, particularly
in this Metropolis, that it is to be
hoped, any Attempt to make our Rooms
more warm and comfortable, and that at a
much less Expence than usual; always free
from Smoke, and equally chearful as with
the common Fires; will meet with the
Favour of the Publick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> are some of the Advantages proposed
by a new-invented <span class="smcap">Stove-Grate</span>,
the Description and Uses whereof are contained
in the following Sheets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> surely, if ever any Invention, discovered
by a Mechanick, deserved the
Attention of the Publick, this may justly
lay claim to it; since not only every Family,
but every Individual, is in some degree interested
in it; and more especially as it is
not offered as uncertain Theory, but its Uses
and Advantages, over all others, have been
confirmed by Trial and Experience: For
one of the smallest Size of these <span class="smcap">Stove-Grates</span>
has been set up, ever since the
beginning of last Winter, in a common
Room at the Inventor’s House, where several
curious and ingenious Persons have been to
see and observe the Effects of it; and it has
appeared to the Satisfaction of the best Judges,
that this same Room, built of common
Quartering, and covered with Laths and
Plaister,</p>

<p>with a Pair of large folding Doors at one<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
End, and a Door opening to the Stair Case
at the other End, in which four or five Pecks
of Coals had usually been consumed every
Day in a common Grate and Chimney, has
been kept warm, ever since the New Stove
was erected, with no greater Quantity than
one Peck of Coals a Day; and with this
singular Advantage, that the Warmth is
diffused, more regularly and uniformly, over
the whole Room, than it was before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who will take the Trouble of
calling, will be able to form a more distinct
Idea of the Construction and Use of this
Machine, than can be conveyed by Writing:
But as many People have neither the Curiosity
or Opportunity for occular Inspection,
I shall give a particular Description of it, as
well as of all the other Machines, that have
been contrived for the like Purposes; and it
will appear, by a fair and impartial Comparison,
that this is attended with greater
Advantages, and fewer Inconveniences, than
any that has ever yet been offered to the
Publick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, for the better understanding of what
follows, it will be necessary to explain some
of the Properties of Air and Fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chief Properties of Air, are Fluidity,
Gravity, and Elasticity.</p>

<p><cite>First</cite>, <span class="smcap">The</span> Air is a Fluid, consisting of
Parts which have not any sensible Attraction
or Cohesion betwixt themselves; but of such
a Shape or Form, as to glide one over another,
and yield to the slightest Impression: Of this
we need no other Proof, than the Ease and
Freedom with which Animals breathe this
Element, and pass through it, without any
sensible Resistance.</p>

<p><cite>Secondly</cite>, <span class="smcap">That</span> the Air does gravitate,
or act upon inferior Bodies by its Weight, is
demonstrable by a great many Experiments,
and particularly the Barometer, which by
the rising and falling of the Mercury, shews
the greater or lesser Weight of the Column
of Air incumbent upon it.</p>

<p><cite>Thirdly</cite>, <span class="smcap">Nor</span> is the Elasticity of the Air
less demonstrable than either its Fluidity or
Gravity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Air</span> is an elastick Body, for if it be confined
or compressed within a less Space than
its natural State requires, it will, the Moment
the Restraint is removed, dilate and expand
itself so as to fill the same Space as before;<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
and that too with such Force, as to break in
Pieces the Glass or Earthen Vessel that contained
it; as may be seen by the common
Experiment of a Bottle full of common Air,
strongly cork’d, and put under the Receiver
on the Air-Pump, when the Air surrounding
the Bottle is pump’d out. But what is particularly
remarkable with reference to the
Subject we are treating of, is, That Air is
rarified by Heat, and condensed by Cold;
First, Air rarified and expanded by Heat,
becomes specifically lighter than it was
before, and will ascend in Air of greater
Density: As Matter specifically lighter than
Water, Cork for Instance, if placed at the
bottom of an empty Vessel, will, if Water
be poured into the Vessel, ascend above the
Surface of the Water; so rarified Air will
rise in common Air till it comes to Air of
equal Weight, or is by Cold reduced to its
former Density.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the same Reason, if a Fire be kindled
in an open Place, the Heat thereof will rarify
the next circumambient Air; and that which
is more remote being heavier, will press
every where, and in all Directions, upon
the Air that is rarified, and drive it to the
Fire; the Flame and Sparks whereof will,
together with the rarified Air, ascend in a<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
conic Form, like the Flame of a Candle, in
a trembling Motion, as it is more or less
acted upon by the Pressure of the cold Air:
And the Reason why the Flame is more
contracted at the Top than Bottom, is, that
the Heat at Top being less intense, the next
adjacent Air is less rarified, and the gross
Air confines it more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Therefore</span>, when a Fire is lighted
in a Chimney, the Heat rarifies the Air over
and next the Fire, and makes it rise in the
Funnel, and the common Air in the Room
immediately supplies its Place, is rarified in
its turn, and rises also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Motion being thus generated, is
continued by small Inlets of Air, through
the Doors and Windows of the Room; and
the larger the Fire, the greater will be the
current of Air through their Crevices. If
the Doors and Windows are so well fitted in
their Frames, that all the Inlets together
cannot supply so much Air as is wanted to
carry off the Smoke, it will then hang about
the Fire, gradually diminish, and at length
totally extinguish it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Various</span> are the Improvements that
have been made in the Construction of<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
Chimneys, to increase the Degree of Heat,
to prevent Smoke, and to save in the Article
of Fuel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> notwithstanding the many Attempts
to remedy the Defects in one or other of
these Respects, the same have hitherto come
short of the End proposed. Take the Article
of Smoke for Instance: No Builder of
Character will pretend to insure all the
Rooms in a new-built House from smoking,
appears from this, that they generally at first
finish the Chimney Tops with what they
call Roundings, and if, upon Trial, those do
not answer, they either Hovel, or fix Earthen
Pots, like a hollow Cylinder, or plant Tin
Tubes on the Tops, not much unlike Organ-Pipes
inverted; all which Methods, not
only spoil the Symmetry of the Building,
but what is still worse, they often leave the
Chimnies as Smoky as they were at first,
after a considerable Sum has been spent on a
Cure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> order to remedy all, or some of the
Inconveniences already mentioned, a great
Variety of Chimnies, Stove-Grates, and
Close-Stoves have been invented. I shall
describe some of the principal ones that have
fallen under my Observation; and shall<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
endeavour, as I go along, to point out their
Advantages and Defects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span>, Mons. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gauger</i> has described
seven sorts of Chimnies, which, however,
all agree in general as to the Construction
and Disposition of the principal Parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">His</span> Manner of Performance is by Plates
of Iron, Copper, and Brass, placed in the
Chimney, after its being prepared to receive
them, at four Inches from the Back, Jambs,
and Hearth, with a Communication to the
external Air; which first entered under the
Hearth-Plate, and made several Turnings
and Windings, through Partitions between
the inside of the Chimney, and those Plates
representing, as it were, a re-curved Canal;
one End whereof joins the outward Air,
and the other comes out of the Top of one
of the Jambs of the Chimney. The Use
and Intent of these Chimnies is only for
burning of Wood, the Heat whereof is
more diffused than that of Turf or Peat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Invention was extremely ingenious,
the Room was warmed, in all its Parts, with
great Equality; cold Air was prevented
rushing through Crevices; the Funnel was
supplied by a Trap-Door, or Bellows, upon<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
the Hearth-Plate; and much less Wood
served to make a Fire: but the Expence
was found to be so great, especially in old
Chimnies, that they never came into much
use, and are now entirely laid aside: The
upright Heat was likewise all lost in all those
Chimnies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Secondly</span>, the ingenious Dr. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Desaguliers</i>
gives the Construction of two kinds of
Chimnies; one for burning Turf and Peat
upon the Hearth, and the other for Sea-Coal
in a Stove-Grate, made in a particular
Manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Description of the First, he says,
That in Chimnies where Wood is burnt the
Cavities behind the Back and Sides, after
the Manner that the <em>French</em> Author directs,
are very useful; but where you have the
Heat very strong, it will be proper to make
the Cavities as near the Fire as possible; and
tho’ the Course of the Air will be shorter,
yet the great Heat it acquires in that Case
will make Amends for the Shortness of the
Passage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Shape and Manner of the Chimney
is the same as directed by Mons. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gauger</i>,
with this difference, that the Doctor’s has<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
no Cavity under the Hearth; only a divided
Box made of Plate-Iron, upon which the
Fire is placed, and an horizontal Cavity behind
the Back, faced with Plate-Iron; so
low, that the Fire lies against it: Through
this Preparation comes a Stream of external
Air, in several Turnings and Windings, and
from thence is carried up a Passage within
the Brick-Work in one of the Corners, as
high as the Mantle-Piece; from the Corner
it is brought forward to the under side of the
Mantle-Piece, where it makes several Turnings
in a Tin Canal, from which it is at last
convey’d into the Room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> likewise recommends the Trap-Bellows
in this Construction of Stoves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Construction of the Second Sort
consists of a Grate of a particular Make,
with a Box of Plate-Iron behind the Back,
that has only three Cavities; one End
communicates with the outward Air to
bring it through those Cavities, obliquely, to
the Corner in the Brick-Work; from thence
it is brought forward in the upper part of
the Jamb, quite into the Tin Canal, behind
the Mantle-Piece, as in the last Construction;
but the same Inconvenience attends both
these sort of Chimnies, that the upright<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
Heat, which is at least three-fourths of
what proceeds from the Fire, is almost
wholly lost; as it is in all the open Fire-Places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thirdly</span>, the <em>Dutch</em> and <em>German</em>
Stoves, which are very different.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <em>Dutch</em> Stove has a Flue proceeding
from the Top, which is sometimes bent
downwards, and then goes into the Chimney,
through a false Back, at about four Inches
from the true Back: That Space has a
Communication with the Funnel, and all
the other Parts of the Chimney are wholly
closed up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> there are others which have the
Flue straight upward, that goes into the
Chimney, and all the Funnel closed up
round the Flue of the Stove. The First
Sort, in my Opinion, is the best; for there
is not so much of the upright Heat lost as
in this, and the Chimney cannot so readily
smoke; because the Space between the false
Back and the true Back obstruct, in some
degree, the Passage of the Air down the
Chimney. Both these sorts have a small
Iron Door into the Room, which in some
degree changes the Air as it flows to that<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
Opening; part of which goes off with the
Smoke, and its Place is supplied by the
entering Air from Doors, Windows, and
Crevices. But as there is so small a Change
of Air, the Room will soon be warm, the
Chimney being wholly closed up; very little
Air is required to supply the small Door of
the Stove, and that only can enter at the
Door or Windows of the Room: Little
Fuel serves, for almost all the Heat is saved.
This small change of Air makes these Stoves
wholesomer, or at least pleasanter, than the
<em>German</em> Stoves, but there is little sight of
the Fire; and no other Use can be made of
it but to warm the Room: And if any ill
Smell should happen in the Room, it is not
easily carried off, by Reason of the slow
change of Air at the little Iron Door; and
the Room is always somewhat suffocating,
especially to those who are not accustomed
to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <em>German</em> Stove is not unlike a Chest
for Cloaths set upon one End, and is fixed
into the Wall, with the Top turned outwards,
or into another Room, which open and
shut as there is occasion for making and
mending the Fire: it warms a Room all over
in a very little Time, with little Fuel to
make a Fire; no fresh Air can enter the<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
Room if the Door be left open, no more
than it would in an open Oven, because
there is not the least Discharge of Air in the
Room. But there is not any Appearance of
Fire to be seen in these Stoves, and they
who used them were obliged to breathe the
same unchanged elemental Air, mixed with
that inspired by all the Company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourthly</span>, the Chimney, in the
House of Lords, which was designed by
way of an Improvement upon the Sieur
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gauger</i>’s Chimnies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> <em>First</em>, the outward Air, from below
the House, in the Passage, enters under the
Iron Plate, (commonly called the Hearth-Plate)
which is prepared to receive it into a
re-curved Canal, and from thence passes up
the back Plate of Iron, in the like Turnings
and Windings, near to the Top, where it
is divided, and enters into two Tubes of
Copper, one placed on each side of the
Funnel, of a sufficient Length to appear above
the Cornish; there they are joined to
other Conveyances; one of which is carried
round the Throne, and ends over-against the
Fire; and the other Conveyance is continued
to the Window, above the Cornish,
made of Tin, in form of a right-angled<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
Triangle, and is perforated to let out the
Air. There is likewise a Valve in each of
these Copper Pipes or Tubes, placed at a
considerable distance from the Fire, to open
and shut at pleasure, by a Thumb-Latch,
which being shut, imprisons the Air in its
Passage upwards, until it be hot, and when
opened, discharges this warmed Air near
the Cieling, through those perforated Conveyances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to the Construction of
this Fire-Place, it is next to an Impossibility
to warm that House with the greatest Fire
that can be made in it: For all the upright
Heat is lost, occasioned by the continual
Current of Air coming in at the Doors and
Crevices, which forcibly drives almost all the
Heat up the Chimney.</p>

<p><em>Secondly</em>, <span class="smcap">The</span> Streams of cold Air
which enters under the Hearth and Back
Plates, (where a large Stove-Grate stands)
in its various Turnings and Windings, behind
these Plates, and through those Tubes,
is but very little warmed in its Passage above
the Fire in the Conveyances to the Cieling;
and it cannot receive any Heat from the
Hearth-Plate, unless the Fire was made upon
it, as mentioned before; for the bottom<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
Bars of the Stove-Grate are at so great a
distance from the Iron Hearth-Plate, that
the Fire, with its downward Heat, cannot
reach it; and not above Eight superficial
Feet of the Back-Plate is warmed by the
Fire, and considering the distance from the
hot part, to where the warm Air is discharged
into the House, nothing is clearer, than that
it cannot receive any considerable degree of
Heat, in its Passage through the Copper
Pipes, that convey it to the Cieling; and
where it is suspended, and mixes slowly and
imperceptibly with the colder Air in the
lower part of the House, so that little or no
Warmth can be obtained by this Conveyance.</p>

<p><em>Thirdly</em>, <span class="smcap">From</span> hence it appears,
that it would have been of much greater
Use to have discharged the hot Air immediately
from the hot Iron Back-Plate into the
Room; its Effects in that Case would have
been sensibly felt, and it would then have
ascended naturally, without the help of
Pipes, and warmed the circumambient Air
as was intended; and likewise would have
supported the Fire, without the Assistance
of any Air from the Doors and Crevices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fifthly</span>, Stoves, placed at the End<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
of long Rooms, Coffee-Houses, and Tradesmen’s
Shops, warm the Room in a little
Time; but the Smoke and upright Heat
are both conveyed thro’ one and the same
Tube of Iron, jointed in several Pieces, to
bring them round the Wall and Turnings
of the Chimney, where they are discharged:
but never fail to send out some part of the
Air impregnated with Sulphur, so as to
occasion a disagreeable Smell, and often,
Head-achs and Lowness of Spirits to those
that are not accustomed to these Stoves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sixthly</span>, The <em>French</em> Stoves are
much the same as the <em>Dutch</em>; and I am
informed, that they have many from <em>Holland</em>
and <em>Germany</em>; but they have another Sort,
which is the Mode at present; it resembles
an old-fashion’d low Chest of Drawers with
a flat Top, and has swelling or rising
Mouldings on all Sides, which represent
the Drawers: It is composed of several
Pieces of burnt Earth, in the manner of
our Earthen Ware, and is placed upon a
Frame of Iron at Bottom, and all the Parts
are luted together to complete the Body: It
is likewise bound about with two Iron Belts
to keep all tight, and has a little Door at one
End like a <em>Dutch</em> Stove, where the Fire is
put into it; it projects into the Room some<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
distance from the Chimney, and gives Heat
from the four Sides as well as the Top;
There is a Flue proceeds from the back
Part, and an Iron Pipe fixed upon it, to
reach the Chimney; which carries the
Smoke up the Funnel, and the Chimney is
closed up all round the Iron Pipe; it is on
the same Principles as the <em>Dutch</em> Stove, and
is subject to many more Inconveniences,
which are not necessary to be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seventhly</span>, The <em>Pensilvanian</em> Stove-Grate
comes lastly to be considered, which
is a curious Invention indeed, contrived
about Twelve or Fourteen Years ago, and
particularly described by Mr. <em>Franklin</em> of
<em>Philadelphia</em>, in a Treatise intitled, <cite>An
Account of the New-Invented</cite> Pensilvanian
<cite>Fire-Places</cite>, <em>printed at</em> Philadelphia <em>in</em> 1744.
I have lately examined one that was made
in that Country, all of cast Iron, which I
believe to be the only one in <em>England</em>; and
at the same time I saw a perfect Model of
it, which discovered the whole Work at
one View.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Stove-Grate must infallibly cure
most of the Inconveniences, with which the
other sorts before-mentioned are attended,
if the Smoke Passages can be kept clean.<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
You have a full Sight of the Fire, nor does
it lose any of the upright Heat, as in common
Fire-Places, and smoky Chimnies will
be often cured by it. This Stove has likewise
the Advantage of a constant Supply of
fresh Air, coming in warm through a Canal,
in the Manner before described by Dr.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Desaguliers</i>, with this difference, that here
the warm Air comes out on each Side of
the Stove, and is better adapted to warm the
lower Air of the Room, than if it came
out higher in the Chimney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this Machine the Smoke first ascends,
and then passing over the Iron Plates that
compose the warm Air Box, descends to
the Bottom, where it passes under a false
Back, about three or four Inches from the
true Back of the Chimney; then ascends a
second time up the Funnel of the Chimney,
and passes out at the Top. The Chimney
is closed up on all Sides, between the false
Back and Breast of the Chimney, except
only in one Place, where is an Opening,
with an Iron Door, large enough for a
Chimney-Sweeper to creep through, to
sweep the Funnel; but at all other times
this Door is kept shut. There is also a
Register fixed in the Smoke-Passage, to give
more or less Vent, as shall be required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> whole is a compleat Piece of
Machinery, and was first intended for burning
of Wood, which is the common Fuel
of that Country; but, for that Reason, is
not so well adapted to burn Sea-Coal, whose
bituminous Quality would soon close up the
narrow Smoke-Passage, and would often
require cleaning, and become very troublesome,
it being difficult to come at the
Smoke-Passage; for if there be a Trap-Door
made upon the Hearth, you cannot
clean the Smoke-Passage any farther than
to the Register, and there is no coming at
the upper part without lifting up the Top
of the Machine, which is always luted
down, and fastened with Screw Nuts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Defects and Inconveniences that
I have occasionally pointed out, in the
Chimneys and Stoves already described, put
me upon contriving a new Machine-Grate,
which, upon Trial, answers all the Ends
that I proposed by it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is built, indeed, and constructed upon
almost the same Principles with the <em>Pensilvanian</em>
Stove, but with greater Advantages;
for instead of the narrow Passage for the Smoke
in the <em>Pensilvanian</em> Stove, there is a Chamber
made in the Brick-Work which effectually<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
warms the Air-Box, and is all covered over
like an Oven, except a narrow Passage made of
Plate-Iron, with a Register in it, which has
a Handle into the Room, and may be
turned upon its Axis to such a Degree of
Vent, as either to support or diminish, or
even to extinguish the Fire. The Register
is so contrived, that it will probably want no
cleaning in two or three Years; but if it
should, by lifting up the Chimney-Sweeper’s
Door, it is done in one Minute; and is
equally adapted to burn Coals or Wood,
with more Safety and Ease than in a common
Fire-Place. The Chamber behind the
Stove is cleaned when the Chimney is swept,
by taking out a Piece of concealed Iron,
rabited into the Brick-Work at the Side of
the Stove, and always whiten’d over with
the Brick Back. The Chamber behind is
of greater Use than warming the Air Box;
for being almost all closed up, it is not only
Proof against the Influence of the Houses
and Chimnies about it that stand higher,
but even against Eddy, or Whirl-winds, if
they should come down the Chimney; the
Force whereof is broke by the Top of the
Chamber; and what comes through the
small Opening where the Register is placed,
is immediately expanded and loses its Force.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> whole of my Machine is less complex,<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
and of more easy Construction than
any others I have mentioned, and which is
all I have ever seen or heard of; but has
Advantages besides that, which no former
Invention can pretend to.</p>

<p><em>First</em>, <span class="smcap">It</span> warms the Room equally all
over, and the Fire appears the same as in a
common Stove-Grate; yet any Place in the
Room will be as warm as that by the Side
of the Fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> this there is occular Demonstration,
because Thermometers placed in the remotest
Parts of the Room will not differ above one
Degree, (a Difference which every body
knows has scarce any Effect) from one
placed by the Side of the Chimney.</p>

<p><em>Secondly</em>, <span class="smcap">The</span> Chimney is so intirely
closed up, that if you sit near the Fire-Place,
there is not the least cold Air from the
Door, Window, or any Crevice, that can
offend you, as in common Fire-Places;
where, at the same time that you are burnt
before, you are ready to freeze behind: but,
on the contrary, the warm Air here goes out
at the Door when opened, and will make
you sensible of its Approach at Four or Five
Feet distance before you enter the Door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Doors, indeed, ought to be kept
shut; because otherwise the warm Air will
be wasted, as with common Fires; but there
is no manner of Occasion for Skreens of any
sort, because the Fire cannot hurt the Face;
neither can the cold Air offend the Back,
as in common Rooms, where there is a
common Stove-Grate, and a large Draught
up the Chimney.</p>

<p><em>Thirdly</em>, <span class="smcap">To</span> be soon and agreeably
warmed, is not the only Advantage we have
from this Invention; but we are better
warmed, at less than one Third of the usual
Expence, at a moderate Computation. When
the Mercury in my Thermometer, that was
placed without Doors, stood the last Winter
at Four Degrees below the Freezing Point,
a Peck of Coals (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> the 144th Part of a
Chaldron,) was sufficient to warm the Room
for the whole Day, from Eight in the Morning
to Eleven at Night. During all that
Time the Mercury within the Room stood
from 60 to 64 Degrees; much the same
Degree of Heat with that of the 25th Day
of last <em>June</em>, 1752, at Two o’Clock in
the Afternoon; and, when that Observation
was made, the Weather was as warm as
usual at that Time of the Year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> before I set up this Stove, which is
one of the smallest, there was seldom spent,
in the Room, less than a Bushel of Coals,
and sometimes more, in one Day, according
to the Degree of Cold; and then we were
obliged to have a Skreen to keep off the
cold Air from the Backs of those who sat
near the Fire; and only that Part of the
Room was warm which was nearest the
Fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Air that enters the Room, through
the Iron Canal of the Air-Box, is both
fresh and warm; and computing the Swiftness
of its Motion with the Area of its
Passage, it will appear, that Ten Barrels, or
near 60 Cubic Feet of Air is hourly introduced
from the external Air, if the Door of
the Room be shut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> warm Air comes into the Room
with such Rapidity from the hot Iron Canal,
that it turns several Paper Wheels with great
Velocity, which are placed near the Opening
that lets it into the Room. But as soon
as the Door of the Room is opened, all the
Wheels stand still; which proves what has
been said before, That much warm Air is
wasted in opening the Door; because the
warm, or rarified Air, rushes through the<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
cold Air with great Force: And the cold
Air that comes in at the Door, being an
over-balance to the Air entering from the
hot Iron Canal of the Stove, entirely stops
it from coming into the Room while the
Door is open.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> like manner, if the Door of the
Room be shut, and the Register that is
fixed in the Smoke-Passage be turned so
near as almost to shut it up, which may be
done when the Coals upon the Fire are burnt
to a Coke, then the whole Heat of the Fire
will be forced into the Room, the warm
Air will be stopt from coming through the
hot Canal, and the Paper Wheels will stand
still, as they did when the Door of the
Room was open.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> may seem a little unaccountable,
but, when considered, it is plain, that the
warm Air from the hot Canal cannot come
into the Room, which is already full of Air,
and in a perfect State of Rest, because there
is no Passage for it to go out at; the Register
having closed up the Funnel, and the Doors
and Windows of the Room being shut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Room, in this Case, will soon become
suffocating, in the manner of a <em>German</em><span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
Stove Room, and does exactly point out the
Difference between that Stove and mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, on the contrary, when the
Doors of the Room are shut, and the Register
gives a proper Vent to the Fire, the
warm Air, in this Case, is at Liberty to act
as before, by warming the circumambient
Air in its Passage from the Mantle-Piece to
the Cieling, where it mixes slowly and imperceptibly
with the grosser Air of the
Room, which, in its turn, flows towards
the Stove and Fire; part whereof feeds the
Fire, and passes off with the Smoke; and
the other part, after being rarified by the
Heat of the Stove and Fire, ascends by the
Mantle-piece to the Cieling, as it did before;
repeating the like Circulation as long as there
is any Heat in the Stove. By which it appears,
that the warm Air that comes from
the hot Iron Canal of the heated Air-Box,
is sufficient to support the Fire, and carry
off the Smoke, without the Assistance of
any Air from the Crevices of the Doors
and Windows of the Room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> this Means, the Air in the Room
is continually changed, and an Advantage
gained that could never be obtained by any
former Contrivance of the Kind; that at all<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
Times the Air in the Room is as wholesome
as the external Air; and, in some Respects,
more so: For it is apparent, that the Air
issuing into the Room through a hot Canal
of Iron, can never acquire any noxious
Quality; and, on the contrary, in damp
Weather, when the Air is replete with
Moisture, and noxious Particles, it will be
purified in its Passage, and the Moisture and
Vapours will be condensed, fall, and stick
upon the Sides of the hot Canal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> this, as well as other Accounts,
this Stove will be extremely useful in Hospitals,
and the Rooms of sick Persons, with
great Advantage to the Patients: But this I
submit to those who are better qualified to
judge of such Matters.</p>

<p><em>Fourthly</em>, <span class="smcap">In</span> Common Stoves and Chimnies,
the upright Heat (which has been
computed to be Three Fourths of the whole)
is intirely lost, as to the Purpose of warming
the Room, or those that are in it. On
the contrary, in this Stove-Grate, a very
inconsiderable part of the Heat ascends with
the Smoke, and all the rest is diffused gradually,
and equally, over the whole Room.</p>

<p><em>Fifthly</em>, <span class="smcap">This</span> Fire-Place, thus prepared,<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
prevents Smoke so effectually, and so certainly,
in all Degrees and Variations of
Wind and Weather, that the Inventor is
willing to give his Machine, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gratis</i>, if ever
the least Smoke is perceived in any Room
where it is erected; unless it may happen at
the first lighting of the Fire, before the Air
in the Funnel is put in Motion; but I have
never yet seen that happen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no Occasion for Chimney-Boards
in Summer, for by turning the Register,
the Air is shut out; so that both in
Summer and Winter, the Furniture and
Gilding, is preserved from Smoke and
damp Air; which are the chief Causes of
the one and the other’s being spoiled.</p>

<p><em>Sixthly</em>, <span class="smcap">It</span> will be obvious to every
Person, who examines the Construction of
this Machine, that the Chimney will not
require sweeping in less than two or three
Years; and that it is morally impossible the
Chimney can ever take Fire.</p>

<p><em>Seventhly</em>, <span class="smcap">It</span> has been already observed,
that no part of the current of Air, that passes
continually through the Fire, is supplied
from the Doors, Windows, or Crevices of
the Room: For the same Reason, the
Candles, in all sorts of Weather, will burn
clear; the Light will be pleasant, equal,
and steady; and there will be a considerable
Saving in that Article.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p><em>Eighthly</em>, <span class="smcap">When</span> the Room is thoroughly
warmed in the Day-time, it will cool but
a few Degrees during the Night; and by
shutting up the Fire-Place over Night, and
excluding the external Air, the Fire will be
found in the Morning without any sensible
Diminution, ready to blaze out, by the Addition
of a Stick of Wood, or a few Coals;
which every body knows is an Advantage,
that never could be obtained in common
Chimnies, with a Coal Fire, without a great
Expence, and much Danger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span>, and many other Advantages, that
would be tedious to enumerate at present,
will be found to result from this useful Invention.
Several of the Stove-Grates are
already set up; and Orders given for the
erecting others in many Houses in <em>London</em>
and the Country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> are of Cast Iron, in its plain, natural
Colour; and others have a Case, richly
ornamented, that is put on, and taken off, at
Pleasure. The Inventor hopes he shall be
permitted to publish the Names and Places
of Abode, of those Noblemen and Gentlemen,
who have encouraged this undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> this Method it will be in the Power
of those who incline to become Purchasers,
to inform themselves of the Truth of every
Particular, by Persons of undoubted Credit<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
and Veracity; and to know, with Certainty,
what they are to expect, without laying out
their Money, upon what they might suppose,
an unexperimented Project; the Success
whereof might otherwise be uncertain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are Three Sizes of these Stove-Grates,
adapted to the Dimensions of the
Rooms where they are set up. They are
all made of Cast Iron, which will endure
longer, and come much cheaper, than if
they were made of wrought Iron.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I find</span>, by my own Experience, that the
